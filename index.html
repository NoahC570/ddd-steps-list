        <h3>Apply to Penn State</h3>
        <p>
          When completing your application, choose from our twenty campuses and
          select a first-choice and an alternate campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re enrolling in the 2+2 Plan, there’s no need to reapply when
          transitioning to your second campus. This streamlined process makes it
          easy to start at one campus and move seamlessly to another as you
          progress in your studies.

          prerequisite courses at your initial campus.

          During your first two years, you'll have access to a wide range of
          opportunities, including student clubs, organizations, and intramural
          sports, all while learning from expert faculty. This experience will

        <h3>Work with your academic advisers</h3>
        <p>
          During your second year, your adviser will help you determine your
          eligibility for entrance to major and prepare for a successful
          transition to another campus.

          major requirements, you’ll transition smoothly into your chosen field
          of study. These requirements are consistent, whether you start at the
          University Park campus or another undergraduate campus.
